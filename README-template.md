## My process

I designed the mobile first and filled the content holder with dummy texts just to troubleshoot corectly arrive at the actual font sizes and some other specied layouts as provided in the style-guide.md file.

### Built with
The solution is built without any frameworks just as listed below:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I have been building cards in some of my previous projects completely with the CSS framework Bootstrap. Very easy to use. Now to have built this product preview card without using any framework is kind of exhilarating. I did not get it on one try, it is through a series of surfing online. I found this card effect code on w3school.

Also, the idea of using different images for both mobile and desktop was totally new to me. I have been designing responsive mini projects using just a single image. After several attempts, I was able to achieve this. It is no doubt that I was able to learn new things.

The codes below really worked amazingly for me.

```css
.card {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
    transition: 0.3s;
}


img {
  display: none;
}
```

### Continued development

I still have to effectively work more on my use of flexbox in building grid system.

Also, the use of my relative sizing and scaling in responsive design needs improvement which is going to be achieved by practising and attempting more challenges.



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3school.com) - This helped me for box-shadow effect use on my card. I really liked this and will use it going forward.

- [Example resource 2](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This is an amazing open source website which helped helped in different suggestions to some of the alignment issue I had. I'd recommend it to anyone who is trying to get help on front end development.
